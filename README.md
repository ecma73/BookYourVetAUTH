# ionic Cordova Framework -

Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development. The original version was released in 2013 and built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova. The more recent release, known as Ionic 2 or simply "Ionic", are built on Angular. Ionic provides tools and services for developing hybrid mobile apps using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and Sass. Apps can be built with these Web technologies and then distributed through native app stores to be installed on devices by leveraging Cordova. Ionic was created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley of Drifty Co. in 2013.

Ionic Creator is a drag-and-drop interface building tool. App Builder for Ionic is also provided by Appery.io.

# Phonegap -
Apache Cordova (formerly PhoneGap) is a mobile application development framework originally created by Nitobi. Adobe Systems purchased Nitobi in 2011, rebranded it as PhoneGap, and later released an open source version of the software called Apache Cordova.[3] Apache Cordova enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in Android, iOS, or Windows Phone.[4] It enables wrapping up of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code depending upon the platform of the device. It extends the features of HTML and JavaScript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application (because all layout rendering is done via Web views instead of the platform's native UI framework) nor purely Web-based (because they are not just Web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs). Mixing native and hybrid code snippets has been possible since version.

The software was previously called just "PhoneGap", then "Apache Callback". As open-source software, Apache Cordova allows wrappers around it, such as Appery.io or Intel XDK.

PhoneGap is Adobe’s productised version and ecosystem on top of Cordova. Like PhoneGap, many other tools and frameworks are also built on top of Cordova, including : 

	•	Ionic
	•	Monaca 
	•	TACO 
	•	Onsen UI 
	•	Visual Studio
	•	GapDebug
	•	App Builder
	•	Cocoon
	•	Framework7
	•	Evothings Studio
	•	NSB/AppStudio 
	•	Mobiscroll
	•	Intel XDK
	•	Telerik Platform

These tools use Cordova, and not PhoneGap for their core tools.

Contributors to the Apache Cordova project include :

	▪	Adobe
	▪	BlackBerry
	▪	Google
	▪	IBM
	▪	Intel 
	▪	Microsoft
	▪	Mozilla

#OneSignal -

OneSignal is mobile and web push notification and push messaging service and API. Developers and marketers use OneSignal to deliver and track targeted transactional and promotional messages to their customers.

#Firebase -

Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform. Firebase is made up of complementary features that developers can mix-and-match to fit their needs. The team is based in San Francisco and Mountain View, California. The company was founded in 2011 by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin.[1] Firebase's initial product was a realtime database, which provides an API that allows developers to store and sync data across multiple clients. Over time, it has expanded its product line to become a full suite for app development. The company was acquired by Google in October 2014 and a significant number of new features were featured in May 2016 at Google I/O.
